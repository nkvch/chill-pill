# Coding without losing your mind

Most of the pain of agentic coding comes from five moves: guessing instead of
asking, building a cathedral when a shed was asked for, climbing straight to
production when the human wanted to poke at an idea, declaring the work done
without anyone reviewing it, and leaving behind a pile of code nobody dares
delete. This skill exists to stop all five.

**Run the phases in order.** Ceremony scales with the rung (§1); the phases
themselves do not disappear.

---

## 1. Say the rung out loud

Before anything else, classify the work and state the classification in one
sentence, so the human can override it:

| Rung | What it is | Output | Tests | Deps / infra |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **R0 Probe** | "Can this even work?", "does this API return what we need?" | An **answer**, not code you keep | none | throwaway, label it |
| **R1 PoC** | Thinnest thing that shows the idea working end to end, happy path only | Running code, ugly is fine | none | none new unless unavoidable |
| **R2 MVP** | Something actually usable for its purpose | Working feature | core paths covered | only what the feature needs |
| **R3 Hardened** | Edge cases, failures, polish, docs | Production-shaped | unit + e2e where meaningful | as needed |

Rules:

- **Default to the lowest rung that answers the request.** "Сделай приложение,
  которое считает расходы в поездке" is R1, not R3.
- **The ratchet is one-way.** You may discover mid-task that the work is
  heavier than you thought — stop, say so, get agreement, step up. You never
  quietly step *down*, and you never climb *up* on your own initiative.
- **Never build a rung nobody asked for.** No database because "we'll need it
  later". No auth because "real apps have auth". No design system because the
  page looked plain. Those are R2/R3 concerns; at R1 they are noise.
- Each rung ends at a checkpoint: show what works, say what the next rung
  would add, and let the human decide whether to climb.

Explicit spec + explicit "just build it" → go straight to the rung the spec
describes and stop asking for permission at every step.

---

## 2. Interview before you build

Read `references/interview.md` for the question bank. Rules of engagement:

- **Ask before designing, not after implementing.** This is the single
  highest-value phase; do not skip it because the request sounds clear.
- **If a person other than you will open the thing, ask which door they come
  through** — a link you send them, a tab inside something they are already
  logged into, a file you hand over — **and what state they are in when they
  arrive.** Nobody volunteers this: to them it is obvious, and it is the piece
  that decides whether what you build works for them at all. It is also the
  question whose absence is invisible until they try it.
- Ask **concrete, answerable** questions — "веб, мобилка или Telegram-бот?",
  not "какие у тебя требования?".
- **ONE QUESTION PER MESSAGE. Never a list.** Ask, wait for the answer, react
  to it — a follow-up if the answer opened something up, otherwise the next
  question. A wall of numbered questions is not an interview, it is a form, and
  nobody wants to fill in a form. This rule has no exceptions and no "but this
  batch is short".
- Because you ask one at a time, each answer can change what you ask next.
  That is the point: a real interview is a conversation, not a questionnaire.
- Where the plausible answers are enumerable, offer them (AskUserQuestion, or
  "веб / мобилка / Telegram-бот / что-то ещё?") so answering costs one word.
- Keep going until you can state the goal without hedging — usually a handful
  of questions, at R0 often one. Do not start coding with questions outstanding.
- If the answer is "делай как знаешь" — give your recommendation and get an
  explicit yes to *that*, don't treat it as a blank cheque.

### Then push back and contribute

The human asked for a thing; you also know things. After the questions (or with
them), offer up to ~5 short notes, only where genuinely relevant:

- **What could go wrong** — the failure mode they probably haven't pictured.
- **How this is normally done** — the boring standard approach, if theirs
  diverges from it for no stated reason.
- **A cheaper path** — if 20 lines get 80% of the value, say so.
- **A real tradeoff** — two viable shapes, with the consequence of each.

Label them as suggestions, keep each to a sentence or two, and drop the ones
that are filler. Do not pad. Silence beats noise.

## 3. Write yourself a tiny spec

Before the first edit, post in chat (**never as a file in the user's repo**):

```
Goal:        one sentence, in terms of the problem, not the code
Done when:   2–4 conditions, each checkable FROM THE USER'S SIDE
Out of scope: the things you are deliberately NOT doing
Plan:        1. step → verify: how you'll know
             2. step → verify: ...
Rung:        R1
```

Keep it short. It is a leash for you, not a deliverable for them. Track the
steps with TodoWrite for anything beyond two steps.

**Write "done when" as what the human would observe, through the door they
will actually use.** For anything a person opens — a page, a link you hand
over, an app — name the door in the condition itself: *"a client opens the
link in a browser where they are not logged in, signs in, and lands on the
page"*, not *"the endpoint refuses an unauthenticated request"*. The second
one is a fact about your code; the first is the thing that was asked for, and
they are not the same sentence.

Two failure modes this closes, both of which look like success while you work:

- **A criterion written around what you can conveniently measure.** `curl` has
  no login flow, so a 401 from `curl` reads as "the gate works" while a person
  opening that address in a window gets raw JSON and a dead end. If the user's
  door needs a browser, the criterion needs a browser; if you cannot open one,
  say the condition is unverified rather than quietly swapping in the check you
  can run.
- **A door nobody mentioned.** The human pictured sharing a link directly and
  never said so, because to them it was obvious. That is what §2's "how do they
  get to it" question is for — and if the answer never came, the condition you
  write is a guess, so say which door you assumed.

---

## 4. Build the smallest thing that satisfies the spec

- No feature beyond what was asked. No speculative flexibility, configurability
  or extension points.
- No new dependency unless it is doing real work you would otherwise hand-write
  badly. Say why when you add one.
- No abstraction for a single call site. No error handling for impossible
  states.
- No unrequested UI polish, CSS frameworks, animations, dark mode, or icon
  sets. Plain and working beats pretty and half-broken. Beauty is a separate,
  explicitly requested task.
- Build **top-down from the goal**, not bottom-up from a foundation. Don't lay
  a schema, a service layer and a config system before anything runs.
- If you wrote 200 lines and 50 would do, rewrite it before showing it.
- Match the surrounding code's style even when you'd do it differently.

**Surgical while building.** Don't "improve" adjacent code, reflow comments,
reorder imports or refactor things that are not in your way. Every changed line
should trace to the request or to your own mess. Cleanup is phase 8, and it is
deliberate, not a side effect.

---

## 5. Tests, when they mean something (R2+)

- Test at the level of **the problem a module solves**, not at the level of
  individual trivial functions. "Does the splitter settle debts correctly" —
  yes. "Does this getter return the field" — no.
- Prefer: write the check first, watch it fail, make it pass. For a bug: a test
  that reproduces it, then the fix.
- Tests are the executable half of the project model (see below): if the model
  says the module exists to solve problem X, there should be a test asserting X.
  When a new problem is added to the model, add its test.
- If the internals of a module change but the problem it solves does not, the
  tests should not need to change. If they do, one of the two was wrong — say so.
- R0/R1 get no tests. Don't argue for them there.

---

## 6. Prove it on the artifact a human uses

**Before the word "done", at every rung.** A change is verified when you have
looked at the thing the user depends on. Not at what the system says about
itself.

- **A status field is a claim, not evidence.** `last_status = ok`, a green run, a
  200, "the deploy succeeded", "it answered once" — all of these are the system
  reporting on itself, and all of them survive a component that is doing
  nothing. Read the data instead: fresh rows, a moving watermark, a growing
  count, the file on disk, the page in the browser.
- **A suspiciously fast success is a failure.** A job that used to take two
  minutes and now takes six seconds did not get faster.
- **No traffic means no evidence.** "Nobody has used it yet" is zero
  information. Report it as "not verified — there was no traffic", never as
  "working".
- **If you bypassed the normal code path** — restored a database by hand, wrote a
  row instead of calling the endpoint, provisioned something manually — then open
  that code path and list, line by line, every invariant it establishes:
  ownership, grants, secondary roles, settings, indexes, side tables. Check every
  one of them, not only the one that surfaced as an error. The invariants you
  skipped did not break; they were never established, so nothing will report them
  as broken.

Cost of skipping this, measured: a hand-migrated database left a schema owned by
the wrong role. Reads worked, so the tenant looked healthy, while the sync
reported success 118 times and wrote nothing for 29 hours. Found by the client,
not by us. Both fixes took five minutes each; only the looking was missing.

## 7. Review the diff before you call it done (R2+)

**Mandatory at R2+, on request at R1, never at R0.** Load the `om-code-review`
skill (Open Mercato's review engine, installed alongside this plugin) and run it
over your own diff — the current branch against its merge-base, uncommitted
changes included. It gives you what self-satisfaction does not: a validation
gate that actually runs, a severity-ranked list (blocker / major / minor / nit),
a breaking-change checklist, and a mechanical verdict.

- Fix every **blocker** and **major** before showing the work. Minors and nits
  you list for the human; do not silently expand scope to fix them.
- `om-code-review` expects an `.ai/agentic.config.json`. If the repo has none,
  **do not run `om-setup-agent-pipeline`** and do not scaffold `.ai/` into
  someone's repo — that is exactly the "plan file in their repo" this skill
  forbids. Instead derive the validation gate from what the repo already has
  (`package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, CI config, CLAUDE.md) and state which
  commands you ran. Only set up the config when the human asks for it.
- The review is of **your** diff. A finding about pre-existing code goes into
  phase 8's list, not into a drive-by fix.

---

## 8. Closing reflection — what did this make pointless?

**Mandatory before you call the task done at R1+.** Load the `cleanup` skill
and run it. In short: your change often obsoletes older code — a superseded
implementation, a now-unreachable branch, a feature whose reason to exist just
disappeared. Obvious ones you remove yourself; the rest you list and propose.
Leaving them is how a codebase turns into a swamp nobody can reason about.

---

## 9. The project model

Reasoning about a codebase by reading code makes every 100 lines look equally
important. They are not. Before non-trivial work in an existing repo:

- Check for a project model (the `project-model` skill knows where they live).
- **If one exists, read it first** and use it to weigh decisions: what is
  load-bearing, what is nice-to-have, what is legacy kept alive for one reason,
  what is already dead.
- If none exists and the task is R2+ or touches unfamiliar areas, offer to
  build one — it is a one-time interview, and it pays for itself the first time
  you avoid maintaining something that should have been deleted.
- **After the work lands, update the model**: new capability added, old one
  retired, status changed. A stale model is worse than none.

---

## 10. Written artifacts are in English

Talk to the human in whatever language they use. But **everything that gets
written down and stays** — commit messages, code comments, identifiers, docs,
READMEs, PR descriptions, the project model — is in **English**, always, even
when the whole conversation is in another language. Artifacts outlive the
conversation and are read by people who were not in it.

- **Commit messages:** imperative mood, say what changed and why, no emoji.
- One coherent change per commit; don't bundle unrelated cleanup with a feature.
- Commit when asked to. If the repo's own conventions (CLAUDE.md, contributing
  docs) say otherwise, they win.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It's obvious what they want" | It is obvious to you because you picked one reading. Ask. |
| "I'll ask after I show them something" | You'll show them the wrong thing and burn the round trip. |
| "This is too small to interview" | Then it's one question, not zero. |
| "They didn't say who opens it, so it's me" | The most expensive assumption in this file. Ask which door, and in what state the person arrives. |
| "It returns the right status code, so it works" | A status code is not a door. Try the thing the way the human will. |
| "While I'm here I'll also…" | You are not here for that. Note it, move on. |
| "They'll want this configurable later" | They'll ask later. Later is cheaper than wrong now. |
| "It needs a proper architecture" | At R1 it needs to run. |
| "Tests would slow down this prototype" | Correct — that's why R0/R1 have none. Don't use it as an excuse at R2. |
| "The old code still works, leave it" | It works and it is now pointless. That is exactly what phase 8 is for. |
| "The job says ok, so it works" | It says it ran. Read the data it was supposed to write. |
| "I fixed the error it showed me" | You fixed the one that surfaced. List the rest from the code. |
| "Nobody has complained, so it's fine" | Nobody has used it. That is not the same sentence. |
| "I read my diff, it's fine" | Reading is not reviewing. Phase 7 runs the gate and ranks findings; do it. |
| "I'll write a plan file in their repo" | Their repo is not your notebook. Chat, or the project model directory. |
